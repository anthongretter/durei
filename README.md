A Deferred Update Replication (DUR) educational implementation (DURei), developed in semester 2024.2 in the Distributed Systems chair (INE5418) under the supervision of Prof. Odorico Machado Mendizabal. The `make all` command should give all the binaries necessary for usage. A simulation of a static defined network, specified in the file `servidores_config.txt`, can be starded by `make infra`. And unit tests, using a client mock, can be run by `make test`.
